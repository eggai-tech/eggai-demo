## Message Flow

```
User → Frontend → Triage → Specialized Agent → Response → User
                     ↓
                  Audit (logs all interactions)
```

## Agent Communication

- **Channels**: `human` (user messages), `agents` (routed requests), `audit_logs` (compliance)
- **Pattern**: Event-driven pub/sub via Redpanda
- **Scaling**: Each agent runs independently, horizontally scalable

## Running Agents

```bash
# Start all agents
make start-all

# Individual agents
make start-triage
make start-billing
# etc.
```
