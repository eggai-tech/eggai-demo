## Development Workflow

We have a Makefile at the root of the project that simplifies common development
tasks. It's the recommended way to work with the project.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eggai-tech/eggai-demo.git
   cd eggai-demo
   ```

2. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   # Run CI tests (no external dependencies)
   make test-ci

   # Run integration tests (requires docker-compose infrastructure)
   make test-integration

   # Run all tests
   make test-all
   ```

4. Run linting:
   ```bash
   make lint

   # Auto-fix linting issues
   make lint-fix
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. Run the agents:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
